# Smart Control System

## Description:
The Smart Control System, developed by [Your Name], is an Arduino-based project designed to offer versatile functionalities for home automation and monitoring. This system integrates various sensors and actuators to provide users with features such as temperature measurement, humidity measurement, distance measurement, and light control, all accessible through a user-friendly interface.

## Features:
- **Password Protection**: Ensure security with a password-protected access system.
- **Temperature Measurement**: Utilize an LM sensor to measure temperature and display readings on an LCD screen.
- **Humidity Measurement**: Monitor humidity levels using a DHT11 sensor, with real-time updates on the LCD.
- **Distance Measurement**: Accurately measure distances with an ultrasonic sensor.
- **Light Control**: Control lighting based on ambient light conditions detected by an LDR sensor.

## Additional Features:
- **Temperature Alarm**: Sound an alert with a buzzer if the temperature exceeds a threshold value, set at 40Â°C.
- **User Interface**: Navigate through functionalities effortlessly with a user-friendly LCD interface.
